# Uncommon HTML Bug: <object> Tag Issues

This repository demonstrates an uncommon HTML bug related to the improper use of the `<object>` tag.  Specifically, it highlights issues that can arise from missing `data` attributes and the use of nested `<object>` tags.  These issues can lead to browser crashes or unexpected rendering behavior.

## Bug Description

The bug involves the incorrect usage of the HTML `<object>` element.  If the `data` attribute pointing to the external resource is missing or incorrect, the browser may fail to load the content, potentially leading to errors or crashes.  Nested `<object>` tags, while technically possible, often result in inconsistent rendering across different browsers and are generally considered bad practice.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `data` attribute is correctly specified and avoiding nested `<object>` tags.  If embedding various content types, consider using more robust and well-supported alternatives like `<iframe>` or JavaScript libraries designed for embedding media.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your web browser.
3. Observe the error or unexpected behavior.

## How to Fix the Bug

1. Open `bugSolution.html`
2. Examine the corrected implementation of the `<object>` tag.

This example aims to highlight a less common but still relevant source of HTML errors.
