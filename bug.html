<p>This is an example of an uncommon HTML bug related to the use of the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag.  The <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag is used to embed external content, such as a PDF file or a Flash movie, into an HTML page. However, if the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag is not used correctly, it can cause the browser to crash or display an error message.  For instance, if the <code>data</code> attribute of the <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tag is not specified, or if it points to a file that does not exist, the browser will not be able to load the object and may crash.</p><p>Another issue is the use of nested <code>&lt;object&gt;</code> tags.  In general, it's bad practice and can result in unexpected behavior, including rendering issues and potential security vulnerabilities.  Browsers handle nested objects differently, and this inconsistency often leads to unpredictable outcomes.</p><p>Below is an example of an incorrectly used object tag which could lead to a browser crash or rendering errors:</p><code>&lt;object type="application/pdf" data="missing.pdf"&gt;&lt;embed src="missing.pdf" type="application/pdf" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</code>
